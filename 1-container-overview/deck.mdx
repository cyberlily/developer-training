# Container Overview

## What is a container?

* Runs processes in isolated kernal namespaces

---

<Image src={require("file-loader!./images/virtual-machine-setup.svg")} size="75%" />

```notes
This is an example of how we currently run our aps on AWS ec2 instances

Hypervisor translates host-level OS commands to the Guest OS, which is one of the reasons why containers are becomming popular. They eliminate the "translation" slow down.
```

---

<Image src={require("file-loader!./images/lxc-setup.svg")} size="75%"/>

```notes
This is an example of ideal world, where we can put separation between the apps and the host system without leaving the host system. The LXC layer does not translate OS commands, it simply manages the processes using cgroups.
```

<Image src={require("file-loader!./images/macbook-machine-setup.svg")} size="75%" />

```notes
Because our system is not a linux-based OS, we have to use a VM to get a linux system that then follows the container setup from the previous slide.
```

## Container vs VM

* Containers run native linux processes
* VMs <i>emulate</i> linux

* Mention ssh goes to "guest"

What's happening in `create-environment`?

<ul>
	<Appear>
		<li>Vagrant talks to VirtualBox to create a new VM (guest).</li>
		<li>Installs all necessary software onto the guest (LXC, MySQL, MongoDB, etc)</li>
	</Appear>
</ul>

---

What's happening in `create-container`?

```
dev create-container --container public-development
```

<ul>
	<Appear>
		<li>Downloads a pre-built <strong>image</strong> from the image server.</li>
		<li>Tells LXC on <code>guest</code> to create a container from the pre-built image.</li>
		<li><code>/etc/hosts</code> is updated to route the app to the new container.</li>
	</Appear>
</ul>

```notes
The section below is an exerpt of /etc/hosts
```

What's happening in `container-ssh`?

```
dev container-ssh --container service-development
```

is analogous to:

```
vagrant ssh
lxc exec service-development /bin/bash
```
