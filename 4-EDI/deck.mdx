## What is EDI?

_Electronic Data Interchange_

Standard set of documents used for communicating with a warehouse logistics partner.

```notes
This doesn't mean the contents of the documents themselves are standard (as they do vary between providers), just that
the numeric ID and name of the document are standard.
```

---

## What is Netsuite?

Netsuite is an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planner). It keeps track of inventory, orders, and accounting of both.

```notes
When working with EDI, you will encounter terms and concepts that are important to supply chain as well as accounting.
```

## Types of Communication

* Inventory
* Orders
* Returns

---
## Inventory
### Item Maintenance (`888`)

_AKA: Item Master_

* Tells the warehouse information about the items that we want to interact with.
* Basically an item database.

```notes
This is sourced from a Netsuite saved search. If an item has not been communicated via this item master, then subsequent
documents acting on those items will fail.
```

## Inventory
### Warehouse Stock Transfer Shipment Advice (`943`)

_aka: Shipment Pre-Advice_

* Tells the warehouse that we will be sending items to the warehouse that should be entered into inventory.
* Sourced from a Purchase Order or Transfer Order record in Netsuite.

### Warehouse Stock Transfer Receipt Advice (`944`)

* Warehouse tells us that they recieved the items sent via the corresponding `943`.
* Creates an Item Receipt record in Netsuite.

---

## Inventory
### Inventory Adjustment (`947`)

Warehouse tells us that inventory had to be adjusted (lost item, damaged, etc).

Creates an Inventory Adjustment record in Netsuite.

## Inventory Lifecycle

## Order Management
### Shipment Authorization (`940`)

Tells the warehouse to ship specific items to a location:

* Customer
* Another warehouse (Transfer Order)

Sourced from a Netsuite Sales Order record.

---

## Order Management
### Shipment Authorization Acknowledgement (`855`)

Warehouse tells us that they recieved a corresponding `940` and are working on packaging.

---

## Order Management
### Shipment Fulfillment (`945`)

* Warehouse tells us that they shipped the items to the locations specified in the corresponding `940`.
* Creates a Netsuite Item Fulfillment record on the Sales Order.
* Can indicate short or over shipped items.
* Can include a tracking number (UPS, Fedex, etc)

---

## Order Lifecycle

`940` -> `855` -> `945`

---

## Returns
### Return Authorization (`180`)

Tells the warehouse that we are authorizing a return from a customer with specific items.

### Return Notification

Warehouse tells us that they received a return from corresponding RMA `180`.

## Versteijnen communication

* Communication occurs over FTP
* Filenames indicate the type of EDI document.
* Most handling is in `zumba/netsuite` under an `APL` and `Ext3PL` nomenclature.
